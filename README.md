# JacoRLDR
This is the first working version of using Reinforcement Learning and Domain Randomization to achieve the task of grasping with Jaco2.

To run the program is first necessary to install mujoco210, mujoco_py and abr_control packages.
For the abr_control package it's necessary to install the version of October 2021, because it contains the path planners utilized in this repository.
